# About
This is my config with plugins that I choose to include. I got tired from pre-configurated bundles like astronvim, so I decided to build my own environment.

# Goals
I will try to make this config documented as much as possible. I want to understand what every line of code do and why it is important in my config.
Also, I will try to make this config lightweight, and will not include features that I dont or rarely use.
