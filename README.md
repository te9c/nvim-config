# About

This is my config with plugins that I choose to include. I got tired from
pre-configurated bundles like astronvim, so I decided to build my own
environment.

# Goals

The main goal of this config is to provide a simple worktool for editing
code while keeping it lightweight and fast experience. For more 
heavy tasks I have full-weight IDE's.

# Plugin manager

I will choose [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim), because I
familiar with it from my astronvim config.

## Plugins

No plugin list because I'm constantly change them. But I'm not a fan
of big, overwhelmed and bloated setups so I try to keep it lightweight.
